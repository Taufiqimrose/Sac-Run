## Development Objectives

### 1. Game Mechanics and Design
- **Goal**: Implement gameplay mechanics such as movement, power-ups, and level progression.
- **Tools**: Java (Codename One framework), OO principles, and design patterns.
- **Evaluation**: Code reviews, testing, and performance evaluations.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Objective**: Use Java to structure the game’s codebase with classes, objects, and modularity.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Singleton**: For game state management.
  - **Factory**: For dynamic object creation (enemies, obstacles).
  - **Observer**: For handling game events and UI updates.

### 3. User Interface (UI)
- **Objective**: Design intuitive menus and HUD (Heads-Up Display) for player interaction.
- **Components**:
  - Main Menu
  - Pause Menu
  - In-Game HUD (displaying score, lives, and collected relics)
- **Tools**: Codename One’s UI components and custom graphics.

### 4. Graphics and Animation
- **Objective**: Integrate 2D sprites and animations for a smooth, interactive experience.
- **Tools**: 2D sprite sheets, basic animations, collision detection using coordinate transformations.

### 5. Game Logic & AI
- **Objective**: Implement the core game logic and enemy behaviors using basic AI principles.
- **Features**:
  - Enemy pathfinding
  - Collision detection
  - Level progression logic
