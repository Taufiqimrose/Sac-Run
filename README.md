Project Description: SacRun
Overview
SacRun is an engaging and dynamic 2D side-scrolling game developed for Android devices using Codename One. In SacRun, players control a character navigating through various challenging levels filled with obstacles and enemies. The game's primary objective is to collect all the scattered sacred relics (referred to as "sacs") within each level while avoiding hazards and defeating enemies. As players progress, they encounter increasing levels of difficulty and complexity, ensuring a captivating gaming experience.

Features
Intuitive Controls: Easy-to-use touch controls for jumping, running, and attacking.
Challenging Levels: Multiple levels with unique themes, obstacles, and enemies.
Power-ups and Upgrades: Collect power-ups to enhance abilities and upgrade the character.
Engaging Graphics: Vibrant 2D graphics with smooth animations.
High Scores: Track high scores and achievements to compete with friends.
Course Learning Objectives
By developing SacRun, students will achieve the following learning objectives:

Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.

Students will design SacRun's gameplay mechanics and evaluate its performance to ensure a fun and challenging experience.
Evaluation Method: Project milestone reviews and final project demonstration.
Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.

Implementation of game logic, physics, and AI for enemies and obstacles.
Evaluation Method: Code reviews and testing reports.
Develop software using object-oriented (OO) programming language.

Use of Java (Codename One’s primary language) to structure the game’s codebase with classes and objects.
Evaluation Method: Code documentation and inspection.
Outline commonly used design patterns and develop software using them.

Application of design patterns such as Singleton for game manager, Factory for object creation, and Observer for event handling.
Evaluation Method: Design pattern documentation and code analysis.
Construct GUIs to control the software.

Design of user interfaces for the main menu, pause menu, and in-game HUD (Heads-Up Display).
Evaluation Method: UI mock-ups and usability testing.
Use basic 2D graphics and interactive elements for application development.

Creation and integration of 2D sprites, animations, and interactive elements like buttons and sliders.
Evaluation Method: Graphic assets review and interactive elements testing.
Explain basic coordinate system concept and their transformation.

Implementation of character movement and collision detection using a coordinate system.
Evaluation Method: Technical documentation and demonstration of coordinate transformations.
Develop a complex application from scratch to fulfil the provided requirements.

Complete development of SacRun from initial concept to a fully playable game, meeting all specified requirements.
Evaluation Method: Final project submission and comprehensive project report.
